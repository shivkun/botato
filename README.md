## üòÆ About <a name = "about"></a>

**Botato** is a Discord bot framework designed for developers who want clarity, simplicity, and reliability.
Where other frameworks suffer from outdated docs, bloated abstractions, and lack of transparency, Botato provides a modern, well-typed, extensible alternative.

It includes a dynamic Gateway client, a fast REST API wrapper, JSON-driven intent management, and typed data models powered by Pydantic.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Poetry ([https://python-poetry.org/docs/](https://python-poetry.org/docs/))
* A Discord bot token

### Installing

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
poetry env activate $(poetry env list --full-path | head -n 1)
```

Run the example bot:

```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-token-here poetry run python examples/basic_bot.py
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

To run the test suite:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Register events with decorators:

```python
@bot.event
async def on_message_create(data):
    print(data["content"])
```

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

For production usage, you can use a process manager like `systemd`, `supervisord`, or `pm2` (for cross-platform Python apps).

Make sure to secure your token using environment variables or secret managers.
